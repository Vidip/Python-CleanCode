Anytime there is a change in ownership I get nervous that the new owners will have the same love for the Restaurant as the original.
With a open mind I ordered my usual dish of Calamarii and veal and waited to see what happened.
I was very happy to see that both dishes came out to there typical level of quality that I have come to enjoy over my many years of dinning there.
Apparently the new owners realize the importance of a well run kitchen and attentive staff.
I plan on continuing my monthly visits.

On a beautiful Wed evening the three of us enjoyed mussels, followed by the lobster ravioli, and seafood fettuccine. Topped off with tiramisu, and a bottle of wine. The mussels were surprisingly spicy given that spicy wasn’t part of the description and caught my guests off guard as they had ordered them several times in the past and they had no heat at all. The type of heat that leaves your lips burning! The ravioli was rich but excellent and my guest raved about the linguini. The tiramisu lacked some punch and flavour and was, for my taste, too much chocolate. At $12 for the dessert I found it lacking. Service was friendly and decent overall, but the restaurant wasn’t busy and we had our dirty empty plates in front of us for a lengthy period before they were cleared and we ordered dessert. Table wasn’t wiped after main course, water wasn’t replenished timely, etc. Dinner was good overall for sure, but for fine dining there were some details which reduced the rating to very good from excellent. I would recommend the restaurant, but note that there are several details which could be easily improved to make it excellent.
